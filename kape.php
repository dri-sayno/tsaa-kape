                    As you take your first sip of our premium Arabica coffees, let your mind travel to the equatorial wonderlands where the brew in your cup comes from. At Kape't Tsaá®, we purchase specialty grade Arabica from three distinct regions: Latin America, the Pacific, and East Africa. How your coffee looks, tastes and smells has much to do with where it comes from, and how it was grown.
                    All our imported coffees have been cultivated at high altitude - between 3,500 and 6,000 feet - because cooler temperatures slow the beans' ripening time, and create more concentrated, flavorful coffees. To ensure we're offering you Simply the Best from each region, we personally travel to various farms and estates to visit local growers and find the best quality harvests. We nurture long lasting relationship with estates not only for the high quality of their product, but also for their Earth-friendly growing practices and the excellence in how they treat their workers and families.

                        Coffee, as they say, cannot be improved upon. It can only be ruined. So, while the conditions in which it's cultivated are excellent, we make sure that our coffee still passes highly selective processing methods, designed to bring out each bean's inherent potential. Once the fruits are hand plucked, the ripe fruit is sorted out by hand before it undergoes a thorough screening process that isolates the best of the bunch for final sorting and export.<br>
                        The quality of Coffee Beans in determined by density, size, color and imperfections. Kape't Tsaá®, we proudly serve only “Primera” - the highest quality coffee bean.<br>
                        Our goal at Kape't Tsaá® is to provide our customers with the finest coffees available from around the world.

                    Travel to the lush, remote lands where our varieties of coffee are grown, and you'll notice stunning differences in culture, customs, language, and ethnicity. But our select coffee regions also share many things in common. One of them is altitude. All our coffee is grown between 4,000 and 6,000 feet - the ideal range for growing coffee. Why, you ask? Because at that altitude, ripening times are longer and the characteristics of the coffee fruit become that much more concentrated, sharpening its aromas and flavors.<br>
                    At all our estates, you'll find nurseries where coffee seedlings and replanted coffee trees are nurtured for their first 18 months. The slopes of the terraces protect the trees from mountain winds, and a steady diet of nitrogen keeps the seedlings growing healthily.

                </p>
                <p class="harvesting-text">
                    The harvesting process begins the moment the coffee cherries are plucked from their trees. There are two methods of removing these cherries.<br>
                    The first is Strip Picking, in which the cherries of all stages of ripening are indiscriminately removed and taken for processing, the idea being to accumulate cherries in bulk for mass production.<br>
                    The second method - the one that Kape't Tsaá®; uses exclusively -- is Selective Picking. This is a more professional method that requires finesse and expertise as the picker evaluates and selects only those cherries deemed ready for processing. This way, unripe cherries are conserved for later picking, when they've reached their potential. By simply weighing the red ripe cherry fruit in their fingers, they can quickly and accurately judge its degree of ripeness, pluck it, and move on.<br>
                    You wouldn't know it by observing, but the Selective Picking requires someone so keenly familiar with the coffee harvest that a mere glance and touch can glean quality in the fruit that the less experienced of us cannot. It's Coffee Mastery in action.

                </p>
                <p class="cupping-text">
                    Before one of our delicious blends finds its way to your cup, it's first got to pass the test in one of ours.<br>
                    Cupping is the industry method of tasting a sample of coffee, scrutinizing it for the coffee's acidity, aroma, body and flavor. Each coffee is usually cupped with multiple samples to compare its quality and cross checked for consistency.<br>
                    The cupping process starts with adding boiling water to freshly ground coffee and letting it steep for 2-3 minutes. After clearing the floating coffee grounds, the next step is to taste coffee by taking a spoonful and slurping it rapidly, so that it fills all parts of the tongue. This allows the taster to sample the coffee's full profile, from aroma to flavor and finish, all in one rapid action.<br>
                    The official green coffee buyer of Kape't Tsaá®, is Jay Isais, a coffee guru who cups all coffees that we purchase to ensure that it meets the flavor profile and standards that we expect from our products. Each year, Jay cups and tastes approximately 10,000 samples of coffee so, on the subject of how great coffee ought to taste, he's the bona fide industry master.

                    And Roasting Completes the Magic

                <p class="roasting-text">
                    Coffee lovers are all familiar with the light to dark spectrum of shades that coffees come in. Those gradations in shade are the result of the coffee's roasting process. Your favorite Kape't Tsaá®, offerings may range in color from the earthy greens of the lighter roasts to the chocolaty browns of the darker varieties.<br>
                    Roasting emulsifies and caramelizes the sugars inside the coffee beans, drawing the sugars out as coffee oils onto the surface of the beans. The oils are what give coffee beans their shine, while the roasting itself is what gives coffee its intensity of flavor and more robust body.<br>
                    How your coffee looks and tastes all finally comes down to the duration of the roast: As a rule of thumb, the longer the roast, the darker and shinier the coffee. A lightly roasted coffee will retain its original green color, and will boast a bright, crisp, and complex palate of flavors with hints of the weather and soil that evoke the coffee's earthy, agricultural heritage. While darker roasts don't bear the complexity and variety of flavor, they've got the intensity and aromas, imbued by the roasting process, and which we associate with fuller bodied coffees.

                <p class="blending-flavoring-text">
                    Blending enables us to match coffees of complementary tastes to create new, unexpected harmonies. Additionally, blending different variety of roasts together can reveal invigorating new avenues of taste, aroma and flavor to explore.<br>
                    For example, a coffee blend that consists of a light roast and a medium to dark roast captures a broader spectrum of flavor not found in single origin coffees. The lighter roast contributes complexity and brightness while the darker roast adds a level of intensity to the overall taste of the blend.<br>
                    At Kape't Tsaá®, we do not believe in batch roasting. In fact, each origin coffee is individually roasted to its optimum level at our roasting facility before they are combined to create the final blend.<br>
                    In addition to blending, flavoring can be a delightful way to add your confection to your favorite beverage. Flavored coffee made its way to the coffee world in the 70s and really gained momentum in the 80s. Flavored coffee does not contain additional calories or sugars and is considered a guiltless treat!
